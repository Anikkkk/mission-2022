                <p>You’ll have noticed that, no matter what’s going on in the world around us, technology is omnipresent
                    in our lives. Whether it’s scrolling through our favorite social media apps, checking the news,
                    paying for something online, or connecting with colleagues using collaboration software and
                    tools—most of what we do relies on some form of technology. Behind this technology is a team of web
                    developers who have not only built it, but constantly maintain it to ensure it works flawlessly.</p>
